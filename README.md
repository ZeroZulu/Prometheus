# 🔥 Prometheus Web Scraper

Prometheus is an advanced, customizable web scraping platform designed for personal use. It offers a powerful graphical interface for scraping, scheduling, proxy management, and exporting data — all without writing code.

## 🚀 Features
- 🎯 **Targeted Scraping:** Supports multiple scraping methods: DOM Parsing, Screenshot Capture, Headless Browsing, and API Mode.

- 🔍 **Visual Selector Builder:** Point-and-click interface to generate CSS selectors for targeted elements.

- ⏰ **Schedule Jobs:** Automate scraping at defined intervals (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly).

- 🌐 **Proxy Management:** Easily add, test, and rotate proxies for enhanced anonymity and bypassing rate limits.

- 📊 **Flexible Export Options:** Export scraped data in CSV, JSON, XML, Excel, Google Sheets, or directly to a database.

- 🛡️ **Anti-Detection Features:** Rotating user agents, random delays, and proxy rotation to reduce scraping blocks.

- 📈 **Progress Monitoring:** Real-time status indicators, scraping progress bars, and result counters.

- 💾 **Export History:** Track and download previous exports directly from the interface.

- 🎛️ **Configurable Settings:** Custom headers, scraping delays, and scheduling frequency.
